## Anime Recommendation
!!! summary "Anime sorted by Difficulty"
	??? info "Information" 
		Author: TyoCre
		E: For utter beginners [0-100 episodes]  
		M: If you've watched more than 100 episodes of anime
		Keep in mind that these are all pretty easy so you can just dive into M  
	???+ note "P.S:"  
		With all these being said, the best stuff to watch especially when you're still an utter beginner, would be something you've already watched. You already know what's going on, which makes it way more enjoyable, even if it means you already know all the twists.
