I recommend storing the link on the bottom of every pages or on top of every pages since It will be easier to manage or just put it on the bottom of the text after the link is referenced, it is also possible to reference browser subdirectory if you wanted to put image instead of link.

Formatting the reference-style link For example if you might reference the Tae Kim link more than once you can used The code used in the text are formatted like this [Tae Kim][The number of the referenced link] [Tae Kim][1] To use a reference-style link you need to store your reference link first, to do that you can use this formatting, don\u2019t worry where to put them, they will always be hidden unless you did something wrong. I recommend storing the link on the bottom of every pages or on top of every pages since It will be easier to manage or just put it on the bottom of the text after the link is referenced, it is also possible to reference browser subdirectory if you wanted to put image instead of link. [The number of the referenced link]: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar \"Optional Title\" [1]: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar \"Optional Title\" Note that you can store more than 1 reference-style link reference-style link in Action If you are new to grammar, Tae Kim Grammar Guide is the most recommended to beginner! > If you are new to grammar, [Tae Kim Grammar Guide][1] is the most recommended to beginner!

Escaping Characters To escape specials character that might have special effects on the md files like * for example, you can use \\ \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e is a verb that doesn\u2019t need an object to make a complete sentence (Intransitive verb) * \u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e is a verb that needs an object to make a complete sentence (transitive verb). * \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e is a verb that doesn't need an object to make a complete sentence (Intransitive verb) \\* \u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e is a verb that needs an object to make a complete sentence (Transitive verb).
